In the process of removing CASA dependencies in favor or RAT, which can also use python3 a few
python3 specific issues were identified:

1) setup.py doesn't like the octal 0755

2) the various __init__.py are not py3 compatible, e.g.


Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./admit0.py", line 7, in <module>
    import admit
  File "/home/teuben/ADMIT/admit-rat/admit/__init__.py", line 7, in <module>
    from AT          import AT          as Task
ImportError: No module named 'AT'
